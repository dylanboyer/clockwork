Clockwork is a productivity aid that helps users keep track of their important, short-term tasks while utilizing a timer to keep them focused.  This app helps users follow the Pomodoro Technique which breaks down longer tasks into actionable, 25 minute tasks with 5 minute breaks in between. Keeping the working time in shorter chunks makes it easier to maintain higher levels of focus and avoiding distractions.
